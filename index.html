You need to check and modify the policy elements as follows:

Instructions

✅ What to remove:
	•	Any words, phrases, sentences, or HTML elements that explicitly state a fee is mandatory, required, or non-refundable (unless it is refundable).
	•	Any mentions of the following fee types (not case sensitive), including their HTML containers (e.g. <p>, <li>, or nested tags if applicable):
	•	“resort fee”
	•	“holiday tax”
	•	“Eco tax”
	•	“destination fee”
	•	“service fee”
	•	“facility fee”
	•	“amenity fee”
	•	“utility surcharge”
	•	“property fee”
	•	Any patterns such as:
	•	“per night”, “per stay”, “nightly”, “daily”, “each reservation”
when these phrases are attached to mandatory, non-refundable fees.
	•	Sentences like:
	•	“This fee is mandatory for all guests requiring parking.”
	•	“included in the resort fee.” (delete only the mandatory clause or sentence containing it)

⸻

✅ Removal approach with HTML nesting:
	•	Remove the entire HTML element (e.g. paragraph, list item) containing the mandatory, non-refundable fee mention.
	•	If the mention is within a nested tag (e.g. <span> within <p>), remove the entire outer HTML element to avoid broken markup.


*** EDGE CASES ***
Cleaning fees should also be removed altogether. However, you need to distinguish between cleaning fees and cleaning fines for policy violations or damages. A cleaning fine is not a mandatory fee as it depends on whether guests provoked damaged or didn't respect a policy like pets being unallowed. In the latter case, please reformulate (replace "cleaning fee" with "cleaning fine". Only convert to “fine” when punitive terms are present in the same sentence/line: "not allowed", “excessive cleaning”, “damage”, “violation”, “non-compliance”, “unauthorized”, “smoking”, “policy breach”, “additional cleaning required”, “as a penalty”, “subject to fine”

⸻

What NOT to do:

❌ Do NOT:
	•	Reword, paraphrase, or modify remaining text.
	•	Invent or add new text.
	•	Remove refundable and optinal fees (e.g. damage deposits, parking, housekeeping, etc).
	•	Remove conditional charges (e.g. parking fee if only charged upon use). Keep the fee amount. 
	•	Remove cleaning fees if they are penalties or pet-related.
	•	Strip HTML tags or formatting for text elements that are not targeted for removal.
